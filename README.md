Application Development using Java   

* Program 1:   
  --  
  a. Calculate and display the area of a rectangle.   
  b. Multiply two arrays and display the result.   
  c. Sort the elements of an array in ascending and descending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.   

* Program 2:   
  --  
  * Create an `Employee` database which stores the following information about the employee:   
    Name, Emp_ID, Department, Age and Designation.   
  * Perform the following operations:   
    * Read and display the details of at least five employees.
    * Calculate and display the sum of the salaries of all the "sales" department employees.
    * Retrieve the details of the "highest paid manager" in the purchasing department.

* Program 3:    
  --  
  * Use encapsulation and constructors to create a class to represent a complex number and perform the following operations:    
    * Addition of two complex numbers   
    * Subtraction of two complex numbers    
    * Comparison of two complex numbers   
   
* Program 4:    
  --   
  * Define a base class called `Person` which stores the information about a person such as their name, age, and gender.    
  * Derive two new classes `Employee` and `Student` and extend the base class methods in the derived class to read and display the details that are specific to Student and Employee.    
  * Display the details of at least five employees and students respectively.

* Program 5:
  --
  * Use compile time polymorphism (method overloading) to compare two strings.   
  * The program should implement 2 different versions of `strcmp()`.    
    * 1st version - compares both strings.   
    * 2nd version - compare a specific number of characters from both strings.    
  * Display the results.    

* Program 6:    
  --   
  * Define a base class `Bank`, which holds various details of the customers such as name, account number, balance and member functions to read, display and an abstract method to calculate the rate of interest earned by all the account holders.     
  * Derive 3 classes named `CitiBank`, `SBIBank`, and `CanaraBank`, from this base class, which offer a different rate of interest.
  * Extend the `calculate` method of the base class within these derived classes to calculate and display the interest earned by all the account holders of these banks.

* Program 7:   
  --   
  * A program to illustrate producer-consumer problem using multithreading.   
 
* Program 8:     
  --     
  * Read two positive integers, perform the division operation on them and display the result if a user enters a positive integer and non-zero denominator.       
  * If the input is negative, or the denominator is zero, generate `negative number input` and `divide by zero` exceptions to handle the scenario.    
 
* Program 9:   
  --   
  * Illustrate the concept of interfaces in Java.
